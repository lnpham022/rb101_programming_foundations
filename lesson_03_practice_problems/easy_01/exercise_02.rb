Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. 
  What the ! and ? do in Ruby depends on the method implementation.
And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

  what is != and where should you use it?
    the != means "not equals"

  put ! before something, like !user_name
    the ! before something turns any object into the opposite of 
    their boolean equivalent

  put ! after something, like words.uniq!
    the ! after something means that specific method is mutating

  put ? before something and put ? after something
    the ? : is the ternary operator for if... else
    it will check if a condition is true before running a specific code depending on 
    if the result is true or false

  put !! before something, like !!user_name
    the !! before something turns any object into their boolen equivalent
